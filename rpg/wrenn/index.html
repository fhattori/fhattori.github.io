    <b>Components: </b>V, S &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br>
    You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within
    range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
    target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A
    flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being
    worn or carried.<br>
    This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach
    5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

    <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Range:</b> touch<br>
    <b>Components: </b>V, S, M (two lodestones) &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br>
    This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object
    you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of
    a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As
    long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in
    any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the
    former damage. <br>
    This spell can physically repair a magic item
    or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to
    such an object.

    <b>Range:</b> self &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Components: </b>S &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Duration:</b> 1 round<br>
    The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening 
    its effect on you and storing it for your next melee
    attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage
    type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time
    you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target
    takes an extra 1d6 da mage of the triggering type, and
    the spell ends.
    <br>
    When you cast this spell using a
    spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases 
    by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

    A creature you touch regains a number of hit points

    <b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a bit of rotten food) &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>
    A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet
    long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each
    creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity
    saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's
    duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape
    or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A
    creature covered in the acid takes 2d4 acid damage
    at start of each of its turns.

    When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases

    <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Range:</b> touch<br>
    <b>Components: </b>S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes) &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Duration:</b> 8 hours<br>
    As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle
    with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When
    you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle
    becomes a magic trap.<br>
    This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful
    Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
    DC to be discerned.<br>
    The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large
    creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the
    spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity 
    saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air,
    leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground
    or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the
    spell ends.<br>
    A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving
    throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
    itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone 
    else who can reach it can use an action to make an
    Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC.
    On a success, the restrained effect ends.<br>
    After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no
    creature is restrained by it.

    <b>Duration:</b> 1 minute<br>
    Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A
    falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per
    round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before
    the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land
    on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.
